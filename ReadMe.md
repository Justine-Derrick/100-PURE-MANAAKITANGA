Hi! Thanks for checking out this project. Just a few things before we start:

Step One: You will need to rename the file "mapKeyCopy.js" to "mapKey.js"
Step Two: Into the new "mapKey.js" file, paste your API key into the "let key = "(paste api key here)""

Currently this application only display's accommodation options in Coromandel, New Zealand.
